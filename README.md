# Cover-page-gen

Ever since joining college we have been troubled by the endless assignments. One of the most redundant tasks for us was desigining a cover page for every assignment.

Most people use Canva or Word to design a cover page and then they have to edit it each time for every assignment. This can be a real problem if you are in a hurry and have a deadline as the process is slow and tedious.

We felt this can be optimized by making a simple web page which acts as a generator for cover pages where one can enter the required details and get the cover page. So that is how we were inspired to work on this project.
